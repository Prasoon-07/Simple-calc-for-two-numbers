Well, this is just a simple program made on python to learn how to implement the so called switch.get to make a simple calculator for two 
user inputted numbers the scope of this might not be much but, it can be taken as a learning lesson for python and thats always great.
# Learning 
This teaches not only how to implement the switch to make it easier for the developer or coder to give multiple user input in a clean way
for everyone who wish to read the code, but also makes a simpler more logical way for begginers such as me to use it instead of using long 
if and elif commands
# features 
the features are simple it can:
1. add,
2. subtract, 
3. divide or 
4. multiply 
for user inputed two numbers. Whilst, maintaining a clean code. 
# Why write it
Anyone can use it or implement it in their own program as long as people learn from it even other people who have began to grasp the 
python coding language such as myself right now can learn something new to implement in their own way.
